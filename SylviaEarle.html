                <p><b> Sylvia Alice Earle </b> is an American marine biologist, author, explorer, and lecturer. After graduating from Duke University with a Master's degree in science she decided to become a marine biologist because she has always been fascinated with the ocean and what lives in it. Currently she works with <a href = "https://www.nationalgeographic.org/find-explorers/sylvia-earle" target= "_blank"> <!-- a link to Earle's profile on the Nat Geographic website --> National Geographic</a> as an oceanographer and an explorer. </p> <!-- a basic paragraph about what she does and her education -->
            
                <p> The success of Earle's career was not an easy task. She faced many challenges along the way, but the biggest challenge was the lack of opportunities given to her because she was a woman. That did not stop Earle from doing what she loved and now she has accomplished so much like starting a marine technology company <a href = "https://www.doermarine.com/" target= "_blank"> <!-- a link to the company that she started --> Deep Ocean Exploration and Research </a> and the Tektite project. Alongside all those accomplishments Earle has managed to write 200 scientific publications which include 13 books and around 80 lectures around the world. People now consider her as "the face of marine biology". The most famous book Earle has written is <a href = "https://experiencelife.com/article/the-world-is-blue-how-our-fate-and-the-oceans-are-one/" target= "_blank"> <!-- a link to a summary of the book and where you can buy it --> The World is Blue: How Our Fate and the Ocean's Are One </a> which tells the reader some facts about the ocean and ways humans can help restore it. </p> <!-- a paragraph about some of the challenges she faced and how she overcame them. also talks about some of her accomplishments -->
